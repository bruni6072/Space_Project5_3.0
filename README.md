# Space_Project5_3.0
###### This is  Project5, releasedfor the Swansea University MSc Virtual Reality.

**Dialogue, Crowd and Story**
------
The story has 3 characters and 1 robot/Spaceship Assistant. 
The first interaction with a “character” occurs, two seconds after starting the virtual experience, the robot explains the purpose of the player in the environment, although the player can not interact with this character, the interaction helps to put the player in context. After a few more seconds, another character appears into the scene, the interaction is a help signal/transmission made through a screen, if the user decides to answer, another interaction with the same character occurs, and the possibility of moving the spaceship is in is unlocked to the player. The Character sends instructions for the player to follow. This involves flying the spaceship into a “supermarket” and buying a certain object. If the user decides to fly to a certain location and land on the “supermarket” island, more interactions are available.

There is a character on the island that does not have a purpose, the only interactions that can be made with it, the user can bother the character. The last character presented in the story is the cashier goblin, which the user can talk to and purchase different items from it.
##
The storyline: The user is the captain aboard a spaceship, after a few seconds of starting the user receives a help signal from another spaceship, if the user decides to answer the help signal the other spaceship will answer back with the thinks that they need for the universe not to be destroyed, after the transmission the user can control the spaceship with the controllers and fly to a nearby island where they will be able to buy the necessary objects for the mission to succeed. After the user lands on the new island, the player can buy different objects from the cashier and complete the mission.
##
The characters have an assigned dialogue that helps develop the plot and make decisions, that can change the story. In the picture below, there is an evolution on how this is possible.
